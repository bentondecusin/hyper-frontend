# Development Documentation

# Overview

In this project, we implemented 

1. A user interface (front-end) for a relational database that does “what-if” analysis, and
2. Several backend APIs, integrated into the existing code base that handle RESTful requests from the front-end

# Front-end Implementation

The front end is based on Next.js, an invariant of React.js but does server-side rendering, and is primarily written in TypeScript. However, future implementation may use JavaScript, which requires less type-checking than TypeScript. 

## npm packages used

- Chart.js (a tool for plotting charts)
- Tailwindcss (a CSS framework that allows users to specify styles in an HTML tag’s class name)
- SweetAlarm2 (a nice tool that displays errors to the user (e.g. Invalid SQL: syntax)

## App & Components

A website is said to be an app that consists of several components. Next.js will smartly render certain components instead of re-rendering everything. One can write an HTML tag as a function call. 

For instance,

```html
 <Dataframe ...>
		...
 </Dataframe>
```

is generated from a function call `Dataframe(...)`

In this way, user can implement each components as needed. More detailed information on Next.js can be found here. 

There are 6 components present in this app: `DataFrame`, `QueryBox`, `DataPlot`, `HyperQueryBox`, `UpInit`, `HelpBox`. An overview is shown below

### `<HelpBox>...` : Provides instruction

When user clicks help button, 

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%203.png)

a help window will be displayed. This window disappear if closed

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%204.png)

### `<UpInit>...` : Provides a space for user to upload file

When the user lands on the website, or when user clicks upload button,

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%205.png)

an upload window will be displayed. This window disappear if closed.

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%206.png)

When the user uploads some file, front-end will check if the file is csv or txt. If so, a RESTful request call will be fired, calling `api/upload_csv` , with the file in the request payload

### `<DataFrame>...` : A place that preview the csv file

Upon a successful csv/txt file upload, first 200 records of the dataset will be shown. For example, when ‘german.csv’ is uploaded, image below will be displayed 

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%207.png)

Note that number of preview lines and the table style can be modified on backend

### `<QueryBox>...` : Provides a input for running read-only SQL queries

Upon a successful csv/txt file upload, the frond-end will allow the user to run `SELECT COUNT` or `SELECT AVG` queries. For example, when ‘german.csv’ is uploaded, `QueryBox` will be displayed 

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%208.png)

Then the user can run `SELECT COUNT` or `SELECT AVG` . 

When the user enter the result, the frond-end will parse the query, and examines if it

- is grammatically correct
- has 1 where clause
- 1 COUNT or 1 AVG
- table name is same as the file name
- is SELECT query

If these conditions are met, the front-end will extract informations such as `AT`, `q_type`, `c`

, `postlst` , `postvallst`

Then a RESTful request call will be fired, calling `api/SQL`

If it’s valid, backend will give a chart.js configuration and `DataPlot` component will be rendered/refreshed

Note: This version only supports single column result, and 1 single where clause. Furture development may lift this constraint, but need to coordinate with the backend.

### `<DataPlot>...`: Display the SQL query result

Upon a successful SQL query, the frond-end will display the query result.

For example, when the user runs `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM german WHERE credit=1.0`, a chart will be displayed 

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%209.png)

### `<HyperQueryBox>...` : Provides a input for running what-if queries

Upon a successful SQL query, the frond-end will allow the user to run what-if analysis.

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%2010.png)

User can add or remove field. Each field will yield a separate result.

When the user click submit, a RESTful request call will be fired, calling `api/whatif_qry`

If it’s valid, backend will give a chart.js configuration and `DataPlot` component will be updated

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%2011.png)

### The overview of rendering is shown below

![Untitled](DevelopmentDocumentation/Untitled%2012.png)

## Note on chart.js

Chart.js is a node package that allows the user to visual data. What you need to provide is a chart configuration, which contains chart dataset. See more [here](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)

Whenever the configuration, the plot will be updated.

**Note**: In this project, we visualize numerical data as horizontal bar. Future development may adjust the styles or change the display styles (e.g. vertical bar)

# Back-end Implementation

The front end is based on Flask, a server package that can handle RESTful API calls, written in python. The backend  exposes 3 APIs. 

### `/api/upload_csv` : accepts an csv file and stores as pd.DataFrame

When a csv is uploaded to front end, backend will 

1. attempt to store it in a DataFrame, named `df`
2. Create an in-memory sqlite3 connection, named `conn`, to handle SQL queries

**If successful, return:**

- staus code 200
- A preview of data frame (fist 200 records), in HTML literal, stored in `data` field of response
- A  of data frame (fist 200 records), in HTML literal, stored in `data` field of response

**If unsuccessful, return:**

- staus code 404
- error messages

### `/api/SQL` : runs read-only query and return plotting data

Such running SQL must only return a 1x1 data frame. This data point will be transformed into a chart.js data set, and then a chart.js plotting configuration. That is

**SQL result → chart.js dataset → chart.js configuration**

Note: This constraints may be lifted for future development. One need to specify what to display in the data plot. For exmple, if we assume there is only a 1x1 data frame, we can just display a single bar. 

**If successful, return:**

- staus code 200
- A chart configuration

**If unsuccessful, return:**

- staus code 400
- error messages (including query error)

### `/api/whatif_qry` : runs what-if analysis return plotting data (original + hypothetical update(s))

The request will contain string fields `Ac` , `c` , `q_type` , etc.

frontend’s `Ac` and `c` will be be transformed into a list of `Ac` for backend

Then for each field, we will call `get_query_output` to get a probability, then we can use this probability to get a meaningful result, as part of updated result

**If successful, return:**

- staus code 200
- A updated chart configuration

**If unsuccessful, return:**

- staus code 404
- error messages (including query error)
